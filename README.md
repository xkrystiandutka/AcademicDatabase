Some of my MongoDB projects from academic.

## TASK1
This repository demonstrates basic MongoDB operations for a university database. The operations include creating collections, inserting documents, updating documents, replacing documents, deleting documents, and exporting collections to JSON files.

Key Actions:
- Collections: Created "Lesson" and "people" collections to store lesson and individual information, respectively.
- Inserting Documents: Added multiple documents to the "Lesson" and "people" collections.
- Exporting Collections: Exported the "Lesson" and "people" collections to JSON files.
- Updating Documents: Updated document fields in the "Lesson" and "people" collections.
- Replacing Documents: Replaced existing documents in the "Lesson" and "people" collections with updated information.
- Deleting Documents: Removed specific documents from the "Lesson" and "people" collections.
- Exported Files: JSON files containing the updated collections after performing the operations.
